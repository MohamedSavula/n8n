To accomplish the task of filling in the date order in the sales order screen and converting it from date to string in Odoo, you'll typically follow these steps:

1. **Access the Sales Order Model**: You need to identify the model for the sales order, which is usually `sale.order`.

2. **Locate the Date Field**: The field for the order date is usually named `date_order`.

3. **Create a Method to Convert Date to String**: You can create a method that retrieves the date, converts it to a string format, and updates the order.

### Example Code

Here's a basic implementation in Python for an Odoo module:

```python
from odoo import models, fields, api
from datetime import datetime

class SaleOrder(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'sale.order'
    
    date_order_string = fields.Char(string='Order Date String', compute='_compute_date_order_string', store=True)

    @api.depends('date_order')
    def _compute_date_order_string(self):
        for order in self:
            if order.date_order:
                order.date_order_string = order.date_order.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Convert to string in desired format
            else:
                order.date_order_string = ''
```

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Create or Update Your Module**: If you don't already have a custom module, create one. If you do, open your existing module.

2. **Add the Code**: Add the code snippet above to the appropriate model file, typically found in `models/`.

3. **Update the Odoo Database**: After editing your module, make sure to update your Odoo database:
   - Go to the terminal where your Odoo server is running.
   - Run `./odoo-bin -u your_module_name`.

4. **Restart Odoo Server**: Don't forget to restart the Odoo server to see the changes reflected.

5. **Testing**: Go to the Sales Order screen and check if the `date_order_string` field is showing the order date as a string.

### Additional Considerations

- You can customize the string format in the `strftime` function according to your requirements.
- Make sure you have the necessary access rights to modify models in Odoo.
